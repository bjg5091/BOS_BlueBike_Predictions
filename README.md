# BOS_BlueBike_Predictions

This project aims to prodivde useful insights on Boston bike-share syste, BlueBike. 

With the weather and academic seasons taken into account, we predict when and which docking stations are prone to be low on inventory. We also propose suitable locations for future bike docking stations near the Orange and Blue subway lines.

We will make Python codes written in Jupyter notebook available as the project progresses.
