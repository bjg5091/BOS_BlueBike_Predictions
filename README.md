# BOS_Bluebikes_Predictions

Bluebikes is a continuously growing bike share system serving Boston and the four nearby cities, Somerville, Cambridge, Brookline, and Everett. Our goal is to recommend sensible locations for new Bluebikes stations for their future expansion. 

We will make Python codes written in Jupyter notebook available as the project progresses.
